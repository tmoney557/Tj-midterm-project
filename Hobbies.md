# Hobbies

One of Tj's favorite hobbies is to play video games. Tj has been playing video games ever since he was a kid. Tj's first video game system was the Gameboy XP. Ever since he got that system as a little kid, he has been hooked on video games ever since. Tj's favorite video game of all time is Super Mario 64 remake for the Nintendo DS. This is the video game that Tj has had the most fun memories with. He played this game a lot with his friends as a little kid.

Tj also enjoys watching his favorite tv shows. One of his favorite tv shows to watch is called All American. The reason why that's his favorite show to watch is because the show is a college drama show about football and that is something that Tj can relate to. The show is about fixing conflicts as well which is something Tj likes to do.

There are a lot more hobbies that Tj has, but he feels like his list would take a lot more than just one page and he doesn't want to waste time.
